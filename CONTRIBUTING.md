# React Next MUI Portfolio - Contribution guide

Hello and thanks for contributing (or intending to contribute). Not much for the contribution guide. Just a few things I have on the backlog that I could use some help with:

- [Pending] **Internal Blog** - A way to write and publish blogs in Markdown format. Must not have to be in a database.
- [Pending] **Image Gallery** - For talks and projects
- [Pending] **Suggestion List** - Add suggestions for other projects, talks or blogs below the single views (as a carousel or a few cards).
- [Pending] **Dynamic OG thumbnails** - Social media (OpenGraph) images for talks and projects

Feel free to add or contribute to any other features. happy hacking!
